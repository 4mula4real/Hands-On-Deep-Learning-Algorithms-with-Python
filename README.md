Deep learning is one of the most popular domains in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which allows you to develop multi-layered models of varying complexities. This book is designed to help you grasp things, from basic deep learning algorithms to the more advanced algorithms. The book is designed in a way that first you will understand the algorithm intuitively, once you have a basic understanding of the algorithms, then you will master the underlying math behind them effortlessly and then you will learn how to implement them using TensorFlow step by step.

The book covers almost all the state of the art deep learning algorithms. First, you will get a good understanding of the fundamentals of neural networks and several variants of gradient descent algorithms. Later, you will explore RNN, Bidirectional RNN, LSTM, GRU, seq2seq, CNN, capsule nets and more. Then, you will master GAN and various types of GANs and several different autoencoders. 

By the end of this book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to implement deep learning in your projects.
